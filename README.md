# 🚂🛂🚦Automation & Scripting
The dispatcher.js & scheduler.js files allows users to write control automation scripts for managing railway operations. This enables advanced behaviors like automated signal switching, turnout control, and event-based operations.

(You need to edit the `DCCExpress/dist/dispatcher.js` | `DCCExpress/dist/scheduler.js` file. 
In the menu, reload the script by clicking on the **Dispatcher** | **Scheduler** icon.)
